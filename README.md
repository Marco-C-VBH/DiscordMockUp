1. We've implemented a feature allowing current channel members to invite others to join. This functionality enhances collaboration. When the user puts the cursor on the name of the channel in the channel list, there will be an invite button showing up that the user can click, then when the user clicks the button, the user will input the username of the user that wants to invite in order to invite the other user into the channel.
2. Additionally, we've introduced a mute user capability, empowering channel creators with the authority to silence users temporarily. When the user puts the cursor on the name of the channel in the channel list, there will be a setting button that the user can click, along with the kick and ban function that we implemented, there is also a mute option, where the owner of the channel can choose to silence any users that it wants.
